//Consider the word "abode". We can see that the letter a is in position 1 and b is in position 2. In the alphabet, a and b are also in positions 1 and 2. Notice also that d and e in abode occupy the positions they would occupy in the alphabet, which are positions 4 and 5.

//Given an array of words, return an array of the number of letters that occupy their positions in the alphabet for each word. For example,

// let arr = "abode"
// function solve(arr){
//   let alphabet = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
// //check that every element in `arr` is lower case
// //then use .split to separate everything
// //then filter indexes from arr and alphabet and compare their indexes
//   return arr.map(element => element.toLowerCase().split('').filter((y,i) => i == alphabet.index(y)).length)
// }

// solve(arr)
