//Given a month as an integer from 1 to 12, return to which quarter of the year it belongs as an integer number.

//For example: month 2 (February), is part of the first quarter; month 6 (June), is part of the second quarter; and month 11 (November), is part of the fourth quarter.

// P : a month as an integer / real whole number
// R : the quarter of the year the month is on
// E : so the month october would be represented as 10 and I would return 4
//     since it's on the 4th quarter of the year
// P : declare the cuarters of the month
//     create a conditional that checks what quarter the num we receive is on 

const quarterOf = (month) => {
  // Your code here

}
quarterOf(8)
