//create a function to detect the original and unique rythm of our beloved leader, typically having a lot of extra vowels, all ready to fight the estabilishment.

//The index is calculated based on how many vowels are repeated more than once in a row and dividing them by the total number of vowels a petty enemy of America would use.

//Notes: vowels are only the ones in the patriotic group of "aeiou": "y" should go back to Greece if she thinks she can have the same rights of true American vowels; there is always going to be at least a vowel, as silence is the option of coward Kenyan/terrorist presidents and their friends.

//Round each result by two decimal digits: there is no place for small fry in Trump's America.
