//Some people have been killed!
//You have managed to narrow the suspects down to just a few. Luckily, //you know every person who those suspects have seen on the day of the //murders.

//Task:
//Given a dictionary with all the names of the suspects and everyone //that they have seen on that day which may look like this:
//return the name of the one killer, in our case 'James' because he is //the only person that saw both 'Lucas' and 'Bill'

const suspectInfo = {'James': ['Jacob', 'Bill', 'Lucas'],
                      'Johnny': ['David', 'Kyle', 'Lucas'],
                      'Peter': ['Lucy', 'Kyle']}
const dead = ['Lucas', 'Bill']

function killer(suspectInfo, dead) {
